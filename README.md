## About Iris Flower Dataset
**Context**<br>
 - The Iris flower data set is a **multivariate** data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems". 
 - It is sometimes called **Anderson's Iris data set** because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. 
 - The data set consists of 50 samples from each of **three species of Iris** _(Iris Setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor)_. 
 - **Four features** were measured from each sample: the **length** and the **width** of the **sepals and petals**, in centimeters.<br>

This dataset became a typical test case for many statistical classification techniques in machine learning such as support vector machines

**Content**<br>
The dataset contains a set of 150 records under 5 attributes - **Petal Length, Petal Width, Sepal Length, Sepal width and Class**(Species).

This dataset is free and is publicly available at the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**
